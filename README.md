My first real project using C++ and the SDL2 library with a focus on learning to use the library as well as experimenting with implementing certain game features to create a platformer like game.  Project was built using a combination of tutorials to organize the general structure as well as independently implemented features like the tilemap, input, and collision.  To run, open with Visual Studio and then run.
